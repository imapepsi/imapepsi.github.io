        <h2>A Little About Myself</h2>
        <p>
            My life is all about learning new things; I’ll dive into any area that catches my interest. I love legos,
            stop motion animation, drawing, yo-yo tricks, budgeting, movies, art museums, books, developing mobile apps,
            and more. When I began programming in my senior year of high school, I figured out how to replicate my favorite
            math magic trick in Python. That’s when I realized that computer science (CS) could be applied in any area I wanted.
            I was hooked.
        </p>

            During my freshman year at BYU, I worked as a programmer for the Information Technology department. Later,
            I became a teaching assistant for three different CS classes, teaching weekly recitation sessions for CS 111 (Intro to CS),
            CS 236 (Discrete Structures), and CS 202 (Intro to Software Engineering).
        </p>

            Currently, I work in the Social Technology Privacy Lab under Dr. Xinru Page, where I’m developing a mobile app
            to help young adults with autism learn how to use social media. The app gamifies social media lessons into a self-paced course.

            Using CS to help people is incredibly fulfilling, and I plan to become a research professor. It’s the best path
            for me to do what I love—learning and creating tech that makes a difference.
