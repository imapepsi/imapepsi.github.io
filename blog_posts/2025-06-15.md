Stepping into motherhood while continuing my academic research has required a new level of discipline and perspective. 
Staying at home with my infant while working on my research has shown me that meaningful work doesn’t always happen in a 
lab or an office or in regular daytime hours.

In this post, I'll offer a glimpse into how I’m navigating the demands of motherhood and research.

## 5 AM Coding

One of the biggest challenges of doing research while caring for a baby is simply finding time. The secret? Work while 
the baby sleeps.

When my son goes down for a nap, that's my window to code, write, read, or catch up on tasks. But naps aren't always 
predictable. Sometimes they last two hours, other times just thirty minutes. And as babies grow, their sleep patterns 
shift, leaving even less time.

Many moms I know make it work by becoming night owls. They start their 'workday' after the baby goes down for the night. 
I've tried that, and while it can work, I've found that waking up early, really early, is far more effective for me.

Here’s why I've become a fan of the 5 AM work session:

**My mind is clear.** Early in the morning, my thoughts are sharper and distractions are fewer. I can focus deeply without 
switching mental gears.

**Progress early = less pressure later.** Getting even a small chunk of work done first thing makes the rest of the day 
feel more manageable—even if nap time is short.

**Peaceful mornings help me recharge.** That quiet time before my baby wakes up lets me ease into the day, get ready, and 
take care of myself: physically, mentally, and spiritually.

**I can plan ahead.** Mornings give me time to set goals and organize my to-do list, so when naptime hits, I can jump 
straight into focused work without wasting time figuring out what to do.

It’s not always easy to wake up before the sun, but currently, it’s one of the few times I can claim as my own.

## Keeping my work in my head

Context switching takes time. If I take the first 10-15 minutes of my work sessions remembering where I left off that's wasted time.
So I've been learning techniques to keeping track of my work so that even if interrupted and I can restart as fast as possible.
