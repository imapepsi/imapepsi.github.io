Stepping into motherhood while continuing my academic research has required a new level of discipline and perspective. 
Staying at home with my infant while working on my research has shown me that meaningful work doesn’t always happen in a 
lab or an office or in regular daytime hours.

In this post, I'll offer a glimpse into how I'm navigating the time demands of motherhood and research.

## Sleep = Work

One of the biggest challenges of doing research while caring for a baby is simply finding time. I've found that the best
way to make time is working while my baby sleeps.

When my son goes down for a nap, that's my window to code, write, read, or catch up on tasks. But naps aren't always 
predictable. Sometimes they last two hours, other times just thirty minutes. And as babies grow, their sleep patterns 
shift, leaving even less time.

Many moms I know make it work by becoming night owls, starting their "workday" once the baby goes down for the night. 
This often gives them a long, uninterrupted stretch to focus. Another approach is to become an early bird, waking up 
before the baby does. Getting up early takes more discipline, but it has some strong advantages that make it especially 
appealing to me.

## 5 AM Coding

Here’s why I've become a fan of the 5 AM work session:

**My mind is clear.** Early in the morning, my thoughts are sharper and distractions are fewer. I can focus deeply without 
switching mental gears.

**Progress early = less pressure later.** Getting even a small chunk of work done first thing makes the rest of the day 
feel more manageable—even if nap time is short.

**Peaceful mornings help me recharge.** That quiet time before my baby wakes up lets me ease into the day, get ready, and 
take care of myself: physically, mentally, and spiritually.

**I can plan ahead.** Mornings give me time to set goals and organize my to-do list, so when naptime hits, I can jump 
straight into focused work without wasting time figuring out what to do.

I'm not always able to wake up before the sun, but when I do my day is much more productive and uplifting. Mornings seem
to be the best opportunity to claim some time of my own.
