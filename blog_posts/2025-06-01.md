Starting a PhD is a demanding journey, and adding motherhood to the mix brings its own set of unique challenges and rewards. 
As a young mom with an infant at home, I’m entering graduate school with a different perspective than many of my peers.
This blog is a space where I’ll reflect on the realities of balancing academic ambition with the responsibilities of parenting. 
From navigating research deadlines on little sleep to finding unexpected strength in the chaos, I’m learning how to grow as 
both a scholar and a mother—one day at a time.

But I didn’t start off here. My career path has been a long work in progress.

## Animation

When I was 12 years old, I started making Lego stop-motion videos. I loved seeing the minifigures and bricks come to life. 
My goal was to work at Pixar and after doing some research I learned that Brigham Young University (BYU) had an animation 
program that many Pixar employees had attended. It looked like the perfect match however it had limited enrollment, only 
accepting 30-35 applicants each year. So, I met with Brent Adams, the program's founder, to find out what it would take to be 
admitted. He told me that in animation, you get to create entire worlds, which requires a wide range of knowledge. He 
recommended that I study a bit of everything—art, creative writing, theater, film, and even physics. Throughout junior 
high and high school, I did my best to follow his advice, planning my classes based on his suggestions and soaking up as 
much knowledge as I could.

As I approached my senior year of high school, I had two choices for my college application: the BFA in Animation or the 
BS in Computer Science with an Emphasis in Animation. I had strong art skills, but I knew I would need a backup if my 
skills were not competitive enough. So, I enrolled in my first programming class to give myself another option. 
Unexpectedly, I fell in love with coding, and what I had intended as a fallback soon became my central focus.

I excelled in my first set of computer science classes, and then, in April 2020, I received an email saying, “Mia, we are 
pleased to inform you that the Computer Science Department has admitted you into the Computer Science Animation Emphasis.” 
Years of planning and hard work had paid off — I was on track for my dream job as an animator, or so I thought.

## Teaching & Research

During my first couple years of college, I worked as a teaching assistant for various computer science classes. I taught 
weekly recitation sessions for each class, including BYU’s introductory Computer Science course (CS 111), where I led 10-15 
students per session. One week, I taught a session on recursion. At the beginning of class, several students mentioned 
that the professor’s lecture had been confusing and difficult to follow. At the end of my class, two students approached 
me, saying that my explanation had cleared up their confusion. They appreciated my simple teaching style and felt prepared 
to attempt the homework. This feedback inspired me to push my teaching skills. I made it my mission to break down complex 
topics into simple analogies, diagrams, or definitions to ease the learning curve for my students. I discovered 
that small adjustments to traditional explanations could significantly enhance comprehension. This experience 
was incredibly fulfilling and sparked my interest in computer science education.

I was then introduced to research developing a TA chatbot that could assist students without revealing final solutions to 
assignments. This project led to another, where I studied how AI can predict student comprehension based on video and audio 
recordings of lectures.

## Pivot

For a time, I wasn’t sure how to unite my passion for animation with my research interests. I felt like I was living in 
multiple worlds: animation, teaching, research, programming. I often questioned whether I truly belonged in any of them. 
As I prayed to Heavenly Father (God) for direction, I felt prompted to keep working in each of these areas. So I continued, 
unsure where it would all lead, but trusting there was a purpose in the mix.

Eventually, I felt the need to explore other research labs at BYU, which led me to the Social Technology and Privacy Lab 
(STaPL), part of the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) group. There, I began developing a gamified educational app designed 
to teach social media safety to individuals on the autism spectrum. Through this project and reflecting on my earlier work 
in AI in Education, I came to recognize that while I lean more toward being a scientist than an artist, I still love 
using my artistic skills. 

HCI research became a place where all my interests could converge.

## The Right Path

As a way to encourage me and confirm that I was on the right path, God blessed me with two meaningful opportunities: a 
poster presentation of the gamified education app was accepted at the International Society for Autism Research (INSAR) conference, 
and I received the Student Path Award from the Women Tech Council in recognition of my research efforts.

This fall, I’ll begin my PhD program, with the long-term goal of becoming a research professor. With the ongoing adventure 
of motherhood, that goal may evolve over time, but at the heart of it, I hope to use my skills and experiences to make a 
meaningful difference in the lives of others, especially my children.
